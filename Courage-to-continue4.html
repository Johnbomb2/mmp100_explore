  <h1>
    The elephant stands in the way...
  </h1>
  
  <h3>
    It seems to be guarding the last part of the path but you are not sure why.
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    you put down your pack and sit down. Some time has passed and the elephant is still there. Maybe it stil sees you as a threat.

  </p>
  
    <i> "I should relax, the only reason the elephant hasn't left is because im also on guard. <br><br> "one step at a time"</i>
  <p>
    The elephant relaxes and leaves a few minutes after.
  </p>
  
  <i>"Thank god the end of the path is around the corner. Honestly im not sure if I should continue"</i>
